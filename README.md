# Simple-Thirdparty-Integrations
A collection of simple scripts to ***assist*** with third party tool integration into **UNITY, UNREAL or GODOT** projects.
Does not, do everything for you, though some scripts may add perfect functionality for you.
These are to assist with code integrations that you are adding yourself, this is not necessarily a toolset for designers.

You will need to own the tools and have imported them into your project before downloading and integrating any of these scripts.
